I am such a humble sweetheart, here is the code for the lovely header and footer. 
<header>
    <a href="index.html"><h1 id="title">BudgetBuddy</h1></a>
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="budget.html">Budget</a>
        <a href="about.html">About us</a>
    </nav>
</header>
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 BudgetBuddy &#9679 Made for College Students</p>
</footer>

This is going to be the best site.

I am not sure where to put announcements, so I am going to put them here for the time-being until I figure that out.
I will have Ellen create the 'Budget' page, and Jacob will make the 'About' page.

I have the html and css for the header and footer, so you can implement that as soon as you want. Any ideas for things to add to either would be awesome. 

Here are some notes from the site plan that seem fairly useful.
