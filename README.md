[START BUDGETING] - Takes you to next page
The “HOME” “BUDGET” and “ABOUT US” on the top should link you to those respective pages.
 
Make it a pre-set budget sheet, sort of like the one presented above. If desired, add a background image behind (Just find like, a Walmart line or something).
Also do me a favor and add the “HOME” “BUDGET” and “ABOUT ME” quick links to the top. I don’t know how I forgot to do that.
 
Insert the names of everyone who works on the sheet.

First slot: Gavin Schofield | Client / Designer
